> OAuth2 server with dynamic client registration, built with Oidc-Provider for RedwoodJS

🚧 IN DEVELOPMENT 🚧

"Authority" means that you are providing authentication or authorization as a service for _other apps_. For example "Sign in with MyCompanyApp", as opposed to "Sign in with Google".  If you're just looking to implement an OAuth2 client in your app, check out [`oauth2-client-redwood`][oauth2-client-redwood].
